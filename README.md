# BikeShare_udacity

## Exploring US Bike Share Data
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to the bike share systems of three major cities â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. I wrote code to import the data and compute descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal.

## Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. The data files contain the same core six columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also provide the following two columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year

## Files
I used data provided by Motivate, a national bike share system provider. In order to run the program, the following files are needed.
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

## Questions explored
The script answers the following questions about the bike share data:

Popular times of travel

* What is the most popular month for start time?
* What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
* What is the most popular hour of day for start time?

Popular stations and trip

* What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
* What is the most popular trip?

Trip duration

What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
User information

* What are the counts of each user type?
* What are the counts of gender? (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?

## Software
The program was written using:
* Python 3
* NumPy and Pandas were installed using Anaconda
